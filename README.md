## Notice of upcoming release

The next release of this software will include a dark mode CSS and better utilization of the rails framework.

## Notice of upcoming repo breakage

An interconnected set of refactorings combined with mismanagement of the git repository (user error) will cause the upcoming release to reset the project repository.

**How this affects you**

It shouldn't. There is no indication this software is being used outside of a few closely-tracked test cases. If you *have* been using this software, contact me for migration instructions.
