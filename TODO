check all database queries for friendly_id
  STREAM isn't friendly


maybe rename builder/query/form_metadata folders so it's easier to access the model/ folder

AudioController#create_from_import_to_album , etc.
AudioController#new_from_import_to_album , etc.
  should the (Album) query be a selectable?
